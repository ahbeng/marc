# m(arc) reads code.

As coders, it’s in our nature to go through lots of code. Not only do we write
code, we also read a lot of it to learn from others, for code review, to find
bugs, or even just out of interest and for fun.

Though tablets and smartphones are devices ubiquitous among coders nowadays,
they are not ideal devices for coding on due to their small screens and lack of
full, proper keyboards. Still, these devices are great for reading code on when
out and about, or in a more comfortable environment away from a computer.

That’s where m(arc) comes in.

m(arc) brings the features and convenience of a modern text editor - syntax
highlighting, code folding, and choice of colour scheme, to name a few - to the
web browser. It’s designed to work well on mobile, and cuts out unneeded
features to make the code reading experience great. And it works with the
services we already get our code from, Dropbox and GitHub, which incidentally
don’t provide a mobile experience tailored around code reading.

Furthermore, m(arc) allows you to sync the files you’re reading across multiple
devices by simply logging in with your GitHub account. Imagine adding and
browsing through your code from Dropbox on your smartphone while on the bus,
then picking up where you left off on your laptop once you reach your
destination. Or perhaps you came across a cool new project on GitHub, but you
have to head out - add it to m(arc) from your computer, and it’s there on your
phone and tablet.

No apps or installation required. m(arc) is available on any device or platform
with a modern browser, and it even works when offline: we save a local copy of
each file you add, so you can read even without a connection.

**Other Cool Things:**

- We actually *have* a build process.
- We have optimized both the server and build to have stellar scores with
  Google’s PageSpeed Insights and Yahoo’s YSlow.
- We probably have one of your favorite code color schemes.
- m(arc) includes its own source code. Read it using it.
- We broke the localStorage storage barrier! (Though Firefox is too smart for
  that :( )
- You can enjoy the wholesome goodness of unlimited localStorage too, with our
  LSD.js (Local Storage, Distributed) library!
